# [My Pasar Malam](https://github.com/PKChionh/my-pasar-malam)

## Inspiration

Pasar malam (aka "Street Market") is a common marketplace in SEA. Often many delicious food exists in these fast disappearing street hawkerfare. Most of the food hawkers are one-man/woman business, resulting in long queues in the hot & humid weather.
